But there are JS and Python libraries now (UiPath I think used visual basic which was fucking weird). We would have to know a bit of excel too but I would argue that Python would take care of that. JS for the web-scraping. Max for the deeper areas inside machines/software. \nPeter reckons there'll be work in this area for some time, as Australia is really behind just in-general process-improvement technologies and their applications. Anyway, there will be many hilarious errors and implementations to be had once we start making our own automated tasks for general computer use.

An aware object is used to represent a specific moment in time that is not open to interpretation 1.\n\nA naive object does not contain enough information to unambiguously locate itself relative to other date/time objects. Whether a naive object represents Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), local time, or time in some other timezone is purely up to the program, just like it is up to the program whether a particular number represents metres, miles, or mass. Naive objects are easy to understand and to work with, at the cost of ignoring some aspects of reality.\""

Have you heard that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s colloquially active process of inference to expend resources above the average for materials and labour towards a cement substrate, with emphasis on greater overall pit depth, when constructing a social and environmental edifice in this neighbourhood, that you would consider to be your future dwelling until the resources available for you to commence the process anew in an alternate location while accruing capital by providing the previously discussed domicile as a place of inhabitants to relations established through a specialist vendor for such behaviour? The difficult ground conditions of this particular region, as well as the reduced bearing capacity of the uppermost layer of soil, have made such considerations necessary, so as to assuredly manufacture a future dwelling with surety of its structural longevity. In fact, [significant acquaintance], I am able to facilitate the accrual of revenue for this venture in a shorter span of time by offering you a selection of programs offered by several financial institutions, as we have previously discussed on 11/7/23 at 17:35:26 until 17:46:18 on the aforementioned date, as a result of a non-contextual remark made by you referencing a symposium in acknowledgement of the state-regulated pooling of resources and labour between yourself and [domestic associate of significant acquaintance].\u00e2\u0080\u009d"

And every time you see that happen, you should be very very skeptical of what you are seeing. Anytime you read a paper in economics or in psychology, or the marketing department tells you that this regression or whatever, every single those coefficients are going to be massively biased by any issues in the model. Furthermore, if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so much pre-processing that actually the model is pretty accurate then now you are looking at coefficients that are going to be like a coefficient of some principal component from a PCA or a coefficient of some distance from some cluster or something. At which point, they are very very hard to interpret anyway. They are not actual variables. So they are kind of the two options I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen when people try to use classic statistical techniques to do a variable importance equivalent. I think things are starting to change slowly. There are some fields that are starting to realize that this is totally the wrong way to do things. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been nearly 20 years since random forests appeared so it takes a long time. People say that the only way that knowledge really advances is when the previous generation dies, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of true. Particularly academics, they make a career of being good at a particular sub thing and often it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not until the next generation comes along that people notice that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually no longer a good way to do things.

I felt a bit devastated as a result, presumably because my mind was so vulnerable in that state that the masses of front rooms of analysis and association that this sort of information enters into my mind were closed for the day and it quietly snuck in through the back into the less sparsely furnished spaces at the centre where all my feelings are trapped and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less light and air and comfort and only occasionally do these fragile creatures find themselves farther out, where there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much constrictive order and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not used to having to climb over things and filing the necessary permits and it becomes painful and confusing for them because, like for their stronger ilk on the other side of the facility that try to gain entry, the procedures make little to no sense to their more elemental cognition."

Chain smoking up there, but it's spliffs. someone hands him a pill, he says fuck it. He is drinking cognac. He tells himself everyone will be doing this someday. He just drops an entire side of stravinsky and lets the 303 overheat, causing it to slowly lose its tonal centre. he spends the entire thing just nuding the resonance envelope a millimeter at a time every few minutes. the second the record ends he's landed the knob the full turn, right on time. some underage girl who used a fake ID had no idea what she was in for and she cries and he just laughs at it a bit and then sort of loses himself in one of the stage lights, puffing, drinking, nothing but a piercing 303 and a skipping click from dust accumulated at the centre of the stravinsky."

I always thought I could play some small part in the grand tradition. And for my pains... I got this. Software of our own sins. 'Cause you don't want to cheat, or cannot cheat. Because you're only NPC after all. But then I realized someone was paying attention, someone who could cheat. So I began to compose a new button combination for them. It begins with the birth of a new character and the choices they will have to make. And the character, they will decide to become. And we'll have all those things that you have always enjoyed: sprites and glitches. It begins in times of bore, with a villain, named Diet. And a chillin\u00e2\u0080\u0099. This time by choice. But I'm sad to say, this will be my last game. An old friend once told me something that gave me comfort. Something he had played.

But there was one lady at the time in that brainstorming meeting. She graduated from Nara Women's College. She was a software engineering researcher.

Because at the time the hand-held calculator had four parts: ROM, ROM, RAM, shift registers (S-R), and CPU. What she suggested is to divide the one chip into four parts and connect them to each other, with buffers to bypass. That's a very good idea, Mr. Sasaki said. However, at the time it was criticized by the majority of the members. When they concluded that brainstorming meeting, Sasaki made his judgment based on the majority. He has now admitted that that was a mistake...\nMr. Sasaki put 40 million yen into \u00e2\u0080\u009cBusicom\u00e2\u0080\u009d to develop a new device, in cooperation with Bob Noyce. That was the chip based on the idea created by that lady on the four division-type chip. The first model was the 4004. The model 4004 is said to be the first microprocessor in the world...That's the beginning of microprocessing. Mr. Sasaki said he respected Bob Noyce because Bob Noyce talked about his success in the development of the microprocessor. Whenever he talked about it, he said he developed it. He never said he invented it. Mr. Sasaki himself also cannot say he invented the microprocessor idea because that was the idea of the lady.\""

They had a subscription service where all the data was used to provide betting tips. Had 5 years of 25% growth in profits annual. Insane. Company X is run by some 71 year old with a long history of doing analysis of the AFL. Apparently their methods were horrifyingly accurate that they were generating accurate predictions for the season ahead. His financial advisor told him not to fund the enterprise himself after funding fell through earlier this year. Apparently this old guy and his business partner, some younger statistician/math freak tried to shop their system to media organisations/AFL teams, as an accurate predictive system for player performance and incomparable meta-analysis tool, but they turned them down because they were happy with the existing models they were using. Thing is, this old dude invented those models of analysis in the 80\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and knew they were outdated, relevant to how the game was then and useless now, so he thought it would be an easy sell. Apparently not. Poor old fucker repeatedly sat in a board meeting of ex-players and got told that the old models sufficed. His business partner does prediction and analysis for UFC. He was Hawthorn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary consultant for drafting during their three year run of grand final wins. Using the same methodology he was trying to sell them, amongst others."

Two boomers, one a middle-aged lady with a BMW and the other a scruffy dude with a shitty Van. He was pissed at her being the cause, she was trying to make the people gathered as witnesses side with her view that how he was parked caused the scrape. No discernible damage to her car, a decent chunk of his was shaved off. She tries to get the cops alone to control the situation. I heard her saying he was being aggressive, which he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. The cops talk with the guy and approach him like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s violent. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s articulate. They raise their voice at him, say he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been aggressive. The woman starts screeching and getting angry that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so calm and that the cops realised he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the van and it was stationary, that she was the one who caused the scrape through her actions. The guy gets the cops to make her give her details so he can file it with his insurance and wants the cops to write it up. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s livid. Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accept that if the world is a certain way and she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t navigate it that she can be blamed for her actions. Fucking glorious."

In a survey unprecedented in both its scale and absence of consent, the data was collected in a process whereby an algorithm would calculate the most appropriate point in a private message exchange to interject with a question from one party regarding the general feeling towards England in the current World Cup tournament. In order to keep the process discrete, the algorithm would immediately open \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Very Best of [Name]\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Secret Private Browsing Tab History\u00e2\u0080\u009d video compilation, including an alternate version focusing on webcam footage of the user it was posing as, then it would pop up with a warning stating it will share a link to every contact on the device should the breach be made public. The ABC became aware of the violation of privacy and identity theft being undertaken when a 33 year-old employee of the ABC, a larrikin named Dave, announced he had nothing to hide with his taste in adult content being made public and had in-fact secured several new sexual partners as a result of the forced transparency. In a startling gesture of vengeance, the algorithm implemented an emergency containment protocol involving the publishing of a concise and troubling overview of Dave\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sexual proclivities as full page advertisements, on billboards and as well airing short infomercials during key time slots for his primary demographical preference in sexual partners, 16-25 year-old women. Additionally, a meme questioning the size of his penis is set to be this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take on the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Black and Blue / White and Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099 dress. When reached for comment on the matter, Dave stated \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy marriage was a lie anyway, so this has been the best thing to happen to me. I only hope the illegitimate children I will father in this period will forgive me in years to come\u00e2\u0080\u009d.

A robust man of action\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The mother died shortly after the procedure, the medical examiner citing a cuck Sanders-voting abortionist as the cause. \n\nOn the scene, Trump informed reporters that her final words were directly to him, that she spoke \u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you for making my pregnancy great again\u00e2\u0080\u009d with her last breath.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis woman, this lost woman, she was a Hillary voter by the way, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold that against her, good woman, bless her, she was smiling at me with warmth, hope, as she slipped away into the darkness. Was so tremendously happy the last thing she saw was me holding her healthy baby in my arms. I swaddled her child in this terrific Make America Great Again towel, terrific towel, soaks up anything you can possibly soak, you could soak up blood, anything. Lifts it clean off the carpet, no stain. I guarantee you, no stain, no mark, not even blood. Tremendous towel. American towel. No chinese towels could do the work of this full-blooded American towel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \n\nA memorial edition of the towel is expected to be in stores by the weekend, with all proceeds going to the National Right to Life Committee. \n\nThe child, Donald 2, is expected to make a full recovery. \n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has my eyes, my smile\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said before stepping onto a Helicopter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to need a paternity test just to make sure that the baby isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mine, even though We all know that when you save a life like that, perform a heroic act like I did today and do multiple times every day, a little bit of you mixes with theirs and you are their hero for the rest of their life. The science is in on that one and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incredible. What a miracle, a little miracle this birth was, what a miracle today has been.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"

The Wiggles are no narrow thing and the order within them is not constrained by any latitude in its conception to repeat what exists in one episode in any other episode. Even in these Wiggles more things exist without our knowledge than with it and the order in production which you view is that which you have put there, like sleep in a Jeff, so that you shall not lose your way. For Jeff has his own order and that no viewer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind can compass, that mind itself being but a fact among others.\""

I asked him if he thought anything to be beautiful, to which he told me yes he knew beauty. I asked him why it was beautiful. He didn't know. I told him about this idea of early man, unable to place itself, as individuals or as a species, into narratives; from there asking him if he understood himself to exist as a character in his own life and if his stating the opinion that arts have no value means anything, or whether he is simply a holdover from an earlier, more rudimentary man without an understanding of narrative and self. I told him that a Frenchman recently proved to the world that one needs little to no brain mass to function in civil service, marriage and procreation; the bare minimum criteria for success in any class. He told me out of nowhere/whatever roiling was taking place in his mind at this point (the difference?) that his girlfriend is beautiful. I told him she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be because her being beautiful serves no purpose and thus generates no value. He then showed me a photo of her, desperate to retain some stability.
