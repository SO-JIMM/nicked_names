So much of the stuff I end up working on is not remotely promising, just really obviously bad ideas. And I'm expected to somehow deliver good results from someone else's stupid project and horrible half-finished code that clearly won't ever amount to anything useful. I generally get very little in the way of oversight, so I can screw around as much as I want, but it's demoralizing because I know it's never going to change.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"

They do all the ADSR, triggering and sequencing stuff like counting and so on, but at the rate of a signal as opposed to the data scheduler, so they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really tight and luckily he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a genius so they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually quite light in the CPU. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d need to make a device to write and store the values they read so I can send patterns to them, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s looking promising for getting really fucking tight timing at fractional increments. I narrowed down all the booleans needed to make the sequencing parts stop and start cleanly, so now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to encapsulate them into useable tools. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to walk you through installing the library if you are to play the patches I send with them in it, but that actually shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be all that hard on Windows. Macs have some \u00e2\u0080\u009cunsigned software quarantine\u00e2\u0080\u009d bullshit that I had to bypass before I could even load them."

And pretty soon every man and his dog will know how to program using the state of the art established ways ready at hand. Hardware and IoT is where it will be at. I'm more impressed by people who program Arduino than I am on the latest mathematical models to machine learn with - those fuckers at Facebook and MiT and whatnot will solve that.

      "content": "\"The slaughter was even more noteworthy because of an instance of parricide. I record the incident and the names on the authority of Vipstanus Messalla. A recruit to the Hurricane Legion, one Julius Mansuetus from Spain, had left a young lad at home. Soon after, the boy came of age, and having been called up by Galba for service in the Seventh, chances to encounter his father in this battle and wounded him seriously. As he was searching the prostrate and semiconscious figure, father and son recognised each other. Embracing the dying man, the son prayed in words choked by tears that his father's spirit would be appeased and not bear him ill-will as a parricide: the act was not a personal one; and what was one soldier but an infinitesimal fraction of the forces engaged in the civil war? With these words, he took up the body, dug a grave, and discharged the last duty to his father.\n\nSome nearby troops noticed this, then more and more; and so through out the lines ran a current of wonder and complaint, and men cursed this cruellest of all wars. Yet this did not stop them killing and robbing relatives, kinsmen and brothers; they told each other that a crime had been done, and in the same breath did it themselves.\""

He once remarked to Russell how few people there are who do not lose their soul. Russell replied that, in his view, it depended on \u00e2\u0080\u009chaving a large purpose that one is true to\u00e2\u0080\u009d.

But neither you nor anyone else can say anything against his affectlessness, because his whole life was... why, in the 25 Millenia since he and his brother, Uncle Death, started this thing, he never once thought of life. Isn't that right, Uncle Death? He didn't save enough life, let alone me. But he did help a few people die, Mr. Grace, and what's wrong with that? Why... here, you're all dead here. Doesn't it make you better citizens? Doesn't it make you his customers? You... you said... what'd you say a minute ago? He had to wait and save life before he even ought to think of a decent death. Wait? Wait for what? Until children grow up and die? Until they're so old and broken down that they... Do you know how long it takes a working man to die? Just remember this, Mr. Grace, that this rabble you're talking about... they do most of the dying in this community. Well, is it too little to have them die in empty rooms or a bath? Anyway, Mog thought so. People weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t human beings to him. But you, a warped, frustrated old man, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re cattle.

The topic of the interview was climate change and my opinions about it. The assignment was to collect the responses into a survey/graph type thing, I guess to learn about how polls may be constructed. We spoke for about 40min. I know I am a sucker for it, but it kind of gives you hope. She's a smart kid, at least in her capacity to readily call out spurious claims that only a child can deliver so devastatingly. I make such claims often to them, only to keep them sharp, and to allow them to enjoy creating silly imaginative worlds that they can play along with. It also made me realise that they were born readily immersed in established climate research and opinion about what is to come. Different to us in the sense that we grew up alongside the uptake of internet, Sept 11 and the subsequent wars, and the initial public debate on climate change. The internet is a utility to them like tap water, the wars will be a hazy memory, and they haven't witnessed how resistance and denial could be so effective during the \"public debate\" we had."

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something the PowerPoint Programming video inspired in me. It seems achievable. Maybe the ability to do that fade between the average point of patterns across each instrument would be something to try. That would really blur the line between the different elements of the music. The drums and chords fragmenting towards and away from each other, with effects over the top of them mangling and blurring even more than just the patterns."

He served as a mercenary in the army of Henry IV of France against the Spaniards, fighting for Dutch independence from King Philip II of Spain. He then went to the Mediterranean where he engaged in trade and piracy, and later fought against the Ottoman Turks in the Long Turkish War. He was promoted to a cavalry captain while fighting for the Austrian Habsburgs in Hungary in the campaign of Michael the Brave in 1600 and 1601. After the death of Michael the Brave, he fought for Radu \u00c8\u0098erban in Wallachia against Ottoman vassal Ieremia Movil\u00c4\u0083.[6]\n\nSmith reputedly killed and beheaded three Ottoman challengers in single-combat duels, for which he was knighted by the Prince of Transylvania and given a horse and a coat of arms showing three Turks' heads."
