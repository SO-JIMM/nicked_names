It is an open question.\"\n\nWhen challenged by Coalition backbencher Craig Kelly over the idea that corporate tax cuts could trigger a virtuous rise in \"animal spirits\" that would spur economic growth and thereby reduce the deficit, Dr Lowe refused to budge.\n\nIf company tax cuts are financed by government debt, then investors could take fright and \"animal spirits could turn the wrong way\", he countered.\n\nDr Lowe said his calls for the government to ensure it maintains a tight fiscal policy was motivated by a desire to ensure the nation retains the firepower it needs to protect the economy during the next inevitable downturn.\""

A familair feeling that still fits too well.\nThe world is depressing indeed, and i imagine for both of us that has been the given underlying our worlds for some time. This fact is not disturbing to me. It is the perceived unearned, or unrealised, stoic response that people seem to inhabit almost by default that depresses me, as if I'm  jealous in not inhabiting it myself. But i suspect this would be a common frustration to have with only knowing certain sub-populations of Geelong. \nAnd why i mention this is to compare notes. My psych banter mainly consists of \"I report cognitive behaviours x, y, and z. Why do people a, b, c?\" \nI guess what im really intrigued by is your approach to your sessions. It's like Simon Critchley: \"Philsophy begins in disappointment.\" \nOur take: \"Philosophy begins in being mentally ill.\""

Eventually AI will flesh out the dead spots in motion-capture performances, as well as in narratives and visuals. Reactionaries will immediately fetishise traditional filmmaking just as it is fully democratised through state-of-the-art programming environments that achieve photorealistic CGI, as well as capture footage with the fidelity of the highest resolution available beyond even that of the human eye; all done on a smartphone with a rendering time equivalent to loading a website. Most people will dismiss cinema because it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cater to individualist desires."

Man I would like to see him diverted onto the path of Ableton beatitude. But he does not have a computer as of late. And his friends like to party, hence him embroiled in a DMT collection. \nOh interesting website thx. \"Jefferson struggled to balance humane treatment with a need for profit.\" His spirit continues.\nBahaha. It was such a revelation that a) people use substances to learn and b) they can also be used for festivals. Whatever you think is fair and can spare. I found the dex to be a somewhat calming focus (unlike caffeine), but you are right. Like Scharfstein perfectly summed it up about the anxious. The dopamine rush of discovering a school of thought/field/debate you have not come across just makes you want more but it is combined with the highest threat-alert status and feelings of uselessness. Energy meets lethargy.   \nOh yeah shoot me some pages. However, the feels may have to be incubated for years as they search for a description of what it is that leads me to believe there is something there, but simply just fail to grasp what it is. Speaking of which, Tim is finally back on speaking terms with Mum. I may have mentioned, Tim is both starting and is in charge of VCE Philosophy at Marist College in Bendigo this year. Four students. He described to Mum that his syllabus as (in his opinion) \"better than first-year undergraduate of philosophy, if not two years if they apply themselves.\" Which I thoroughly believe. I want the syllabus/reading list, but shop talk is almost prohibited in my family so it would have to be softly softly.\nEnough gossip. I hope you and Meg are well. I look forward to hangs tomorrow. An introductory text to Paul Virilio is explaining my crippling fear of tall city buildings (foyers especially get me) so the virtuous cycle of fear will see me through the evening. I'm sure I will have nothing to verbalise about it when I see you."

Whether \"crime pays\"\n is then an implication of the attitudes offenders have toward risk and is\n not directly related to the efficiency of the police or the amount spent on\n combatting crime. If, however, risk were preferred at some values of p and\n f and disliked at others, public policy could influence whether \"crime\n pays\" by its choice of p andf. Indeed, it is shown later that the social loss\n from illegal activities is usually minimized by selecting p and f in regions\n where risk is preferred, that is, in regions where \"crime does not pay.\"\""

Also by investing an hour of that time we regained from not leaving the office in a personal trainer at the gym on the other side of the same block we can quadruple the cardio we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be doing if we were just walking for coffee, so long as we do high intensity training. We just need to figure out what effect the increased fitness will have in the long-run on base-level productivity during the working hours, as well as including at minimum one passage of a story published within the financial year set in a gym in order to be able to write off the membership to the gym as a research expenditure. But then maybe in, say, twelve months time, granted we have managed to submit the material more than a week ahead of what looks like us already exceeding projections for the deadline, then it could be a good idea to also invest in the gym in order to save on having to spend anything at all on the membership in the first place, which itself could see us so deep in the black this financial year that we might begin attracting investors.

He offered no feedback about the music and just took it and played one song to the guy and that was it. All we got was a \u00e2\u0080\u009che liked it\u00e2\u0080\u009d and nothing came if it, except that he got paid a fuck-ton and we apparently got played once or twice. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paywalled for profit and little else. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not about what the next step is, no one seems to be thinking about where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all going. All I want is to make a piece and then have it be dead to me after I figure out if I learned anything from it that will help the next piece. If my friends like it, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than I could have asked for. Beyond that it gives me pleasure and I feel like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m adding to the conversation. Criticisms from \u00e2\u0080\u009cfan\u00e2\u0080\u009d listeners, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccritics\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the like are rarely constructive. If they are then that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s killer, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so fucking down to talk about the medium and whether what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being heard is conveying anything at all. But maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m saved from it all in that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not trying too hard to convey anything specific because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a direct route to making something that feels fixed in the time it was made more than what the tools used already impart, which is a lesson learned from consuming all the media that I do and reading about it where the reading is good."

The only organisms to use RNA to carry genetic information are\nsome viruses, which are very small and mutate very fast. For example, AIDS\nviruses use RNA to carry genetic codes. Any larger organisms, from bacteria on,\nuse DNA to carry genetic codes. But RNA molecules are used in our bodies for\nmany functions that do not require high level of precision and do not last very long,\nfor RNA molecules are cheaper to make than DNA. The chemical properties and\nbiological functions of DNA and RNA show that fixed cost, uncertainty and\nduration are intimately correlated in biological systems. They also show that economic properties of living systems, including human societies, are ultimately\nderived from physical and chemical properties of particles.\""

      "content": "Oh that's cool man. I didn't perceive any reductions in quality during my Blair-time. It was great to see you guys again! The invitation to Japan hit me right in the human feelz area, and further relieves my bedtime story-like fear that I am not merely tolerated or kept around in order for a high-level joke be allowed to continue operating beyond my sense realm. And I can totally appreciate what's happening up in your ol' mind grapes. \n\nLol. I was going to say the same thing but with myself in place of yourself.\n\nI think I am now more comfortable with remaining silent, instead of being anxious to maintain a \"I am person with informed contribution to the discussion\" airs to satisfy the big Other. Feel free to remain as silent as you want around me, I don't find silence unnerving like many humans do. We both know this world has infinite opinions in its coordinate system, including the underlying option to place those existing opinions into another paradigm. And that a million developments are occurring all the time and need to be addressed. Really I am seized by contradictions and ejaculating the latest interesting opinion I read seems like trying to display a false intellectualism. It all probably stems from having educated brothers that I can never seem to attain their level of (my perceived) intelligence, and also the underlying fear to prove that two degrees weren't a waste of tax dollars on me. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largely why I trip over wanting to discuss things with you.\n\nThe other thing is that you must confront a Jim that has glazed and confused expression on his face when you are saying things. But I am taking things on board and I do find it interesting, really. And what I've noticed in my self is how arbitrary and hermetically separated what it is that piques my own interest within different fields. Like how when it comes to my learning programming and its ilk, I am not interested in the slightest about being technologically proficient (with the latest hardware/software/gadgets) or the next IT entrepreneur or tech-guru or game-developer. What hit me is how ideal mathematical quibbling is and how computation is like the needle that hits the vinyl when it comes to concretely realising mathematics in nature (or at least, demonstrating its realisable \u00e2\u0080\u009cuse\u00e2\u0080\u009d value in nature), and the peculiar language and notation that is used to perform this interaction. So now I have to begin AGAIN which is why I've been getting familiar with different branches of maths and logic (this time with a reason and not just curiosity). It was probably the whole nerd culture that drove me away \u00e2\u0080\u0093 those guys seem smart and deep into the game and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care what you can do with an Oculist Rift or whatever lol. But that is irrelevant to me now. The other thing is I am not in a rush to talk about it or try to explain it (even though I am so excited about it) because I was just like \"oh I need to do at least three years of solid mathematics and mathematical logic in order to feel comfortable with what is I am engaging with\". Voevodsky is challenging much of the orthodoxy concerning the fundamentals of mathematics that erupted ever since the late 1800's. That's not something a smug edge-lord grad can comment upon lightly imo. Side note: Voevodsky is a sweet bumbling man in his lectures and his philosophical justification for reopening the argument (aside from the fact that his work demands this implication) was: \"That our failure to prove that our mathematics is consistent should unnerve any rational mind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \n\nIn a similar vein, I enjoyed your take on the latest major deal involving Disney (I did see that crop up in the paper) but that kind of activity does not strike much interest for me. It is an American deal meaning vastly different implications than what it would be if it were in Australia. And the only thing I learned in accounting is that the figures that are floated around both newspapers and business-papers about what deals are \"worth\" and the revenue/profits quoted are mostly meaningless unless you can understand industry specific accounting conventions and are familiar with how accounting treats mergers and acquisitions. So when figures are floated I'm not really impressed or shocked, but that is not to say those figures aren't correct or significant! But what was great is that you related for me how the meaningful content that is produced by artists and handled by their corporate overlords operates, and what a deal like that affects fans and writers and many other variables. But it just demonstrates how important goings-on can be scanned and jettisoned in my mental life. Sometimes I feel like a robot to what is important to people.\n\nThe final thing is how my mind might appear to operate in a more sluggish manner than your own. I enjoy how your thought performs its leaps with ease, with such speed! And more often than not ending in something fucking hilarious or pleasurably terrifying! If I could explain how my mind works I would recount when Andre was teaching me mathematical induction and proofs last year. He's like \"see, showing that all these other things hold is like showing that if we are able to place our foot sturdily on the first rung of a ladder, we can show how easily it is to climb a ladder using this same pattern to  pretty infinity.\" (Andre has to tone down his vocabulary for me). Jim's response: \"But I'm having trouble understanding how it is you can say that we have even reached the first rung of the ladder!\" Andre: \"....I've never really thought about it that way, nor had the trouble with it.\""

He hands you a drink, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what it is. It tastes like dirt, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s syrupy, you buzz from a small sip. You look into his eyes and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high in a way you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a reference point to rely on. The whites are too white, but at the same time you cannot help but worry that he has contracted advanced hepatitis since you last had to draw upon his resources. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re honestly surprised that he is visible to you in a non-professional capacity, however certain you are that the scene playing out in front of you absolutely warrants his services. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his irises that bother you the most; purple, red, bolts of darkness, but then you never saw him sitting in anything other than a side-profile, where the colour was sucked from his visage by shadows so thick the curtains they cast from appear to be bodies of water cut by the late-afternoon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sunlight."

      "content": "I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m never sure how to talk about it, but I figure here is as good a place as any to give you a heads up about something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been on my mind a lot for a long time and has since been shown to be the case, at least with the one psychiatric professional I am in dialogue with about it. Psychiatrists, I am told, are diagnostic snowflakes, each with their own unique spin on what constitutes a diagnosis. So while not necessarily the rule it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at least the case. \n\nI received an Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis that is along a profile of traits that used to be labelled Aspergers Syndrome before they integrated it with ASD (it was felt there was too little of a difference to warrant it being its own separate disorder in the DSM, however in the ICD-10, which is the WHO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s international diagnostic manual, it is still it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own thing) and that would have been the diagnosis I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have received if I was given it as a child like one is typically meant to be with this sort of thing. That I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t diagnosed sooner is a credit to my intellect and ability to cope with my problems, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not all bad and is in all a huge compliment to my will to overcome myself, but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but feel a little betrayed in that I would have benefited from help specific to my set of chaotic deficits. \n\nNot that I am or would ever compare myself to Wittgenstein in any meaningful way (since he was a) pretty fucked-up and b) clearly his own particular brand of these issues), but reading Fitzgerald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s psychobiography of him in relation to his life and work demonstrated to me that there exists a psychic landscape where I am not alone. The pursuit of solitude, reactive depression, denial/arrogance, fleeing into imagination and imitation elements that are common compensatory behaviours for someone living with the disorder, things laid out in psychobiographical texts about our boy Ludwig and his particular brand of human experience, were so revelatory for someone such as myself who has always felt at a loss to determine why I feel at best alien, or at worst defective and \u00e2\u0080\u0098de trop\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (to borrow his term). So I need to say thank-you for bringing Ludwig the human and his work out of my periphery and into my curiousity. \n\nSo, I have made do with what are my givens. Or least up until the point where I was diagnosed and given medication to treat my still very real ADHD diagnosis, which is something that is regularly comorbid with ASD and is typically the first port of diagnostic call before layers are peeled away to let other stuff become visible and addressed if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re there and need tending. I can admit now that I have that need, as denying myself will only stunt me unnecessarily. I get severely depressed, paranoid, anxious, exhausted, moody, seized-up, bitter and occasionally suicidal (but thankfully that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not often and I have the resources to come out the other side of those feelings in one piece, albeit a little haunted), but being granted access to a pretty convincing source regarding why these things happen to me means that maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have an easier time through accumulating processes I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t given during manufacturing and updates. Although of course there is the fear that learning how better to cope I will suddenly rob myself of some special formula that makes me who I am, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also apparent that like that game at Timezone with the hammers and the crocodiles there can be no slamming down all the troublemakers as the difficulty level rises, so the slightly hostile parts of my ego that fear being common (not the rapper. Fuck, actually gimme some of that sweet Badu pussy, pls life, pls, but minus all the private gigs for genocidal African dictators) can rest safely in the knowledge that I am far from becoming some completely socialised automatical dullard. \n\nMore recently it became clear to me that treating my executive dysfunction didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really keep me from experiencing distress in the laundry-list of areas that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully believe were things that place me deep in the interior of the Autism Spectrum, but these things unequivocally do put me there and I fully accept that now. After all, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t everyone normal to themselves?\n\nIt doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change too much in that I more or less always knew through the characterisations I identify with that I was likely in the ranks of that slice of the population, but either way it will give me access to help where I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realise there was help, such as specific forms of CBT/DBT, how speech pathologists also do things like pragmatic language therapies for social communication, or accommodations for the heinous burnout that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realise was a hallmark of people on the spectrum who are unfortunately required to \u00e2\u0080\u009cpass\u00e2\u0080\u009d as otherwise in order to be independent to the standard of the wider population that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ignorant to how unaffected they are by disorder. Anxiety, depression, OCD, PTSD, social refusal and anger problems - problems that I struggle with - are the ugly flowers that bloom from the seed of the Autism Spectrum when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only the one kind of dirt we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all forced to draw nutrients from in order contribute to the biodome. \n\nBut anyway, I just wanted you to know because it matters that the humans I love understand me better so that we can all understand each other better. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to broadcast it because it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require meds and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my business, although let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not go down the rabbit hole of the subject of \u00e2\u0080\u009cLove\u00e2\u0080\u009d because all the longest sections in the books I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m referencing at the moment have to do with how problematic a thing it is for autistics. I know it goes without saying you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re someone I trust implicitly to respect my privacy on the matter when I am the subject of your discourse with others, but at the same time I feel obligated to give the \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeep it under your luscious red mane\u00e2\u0080\u009d alert, mainly just because the unspoken is my enemy, as I know it is yours, and it kills any anxiety I might experience about public awareness of these issues by stating it outright and then moving on to other more fruitful discussions.\n\nIt just explains so much. I am currently chewing through a text I have been recommended on the subject and it is enlightening in that it is a near-complete and systematic breakdown of my divergences from the oft-discussed \u00e2\u0080\u009cnorm\u00e2\u0080\u009d. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking forward to growing beyond this diagnosis,  leaning in to all the enviable traits that result from this, accessing all the necessary accommodations at work and uni to keep my head in the game and working with a new psychologist to create contingencies that will hopefully result in a semblance of balance to offset the deficits within and outside of my awareness. As well I will hopefully being given a peek at the playbook of the social realm that is currently only written in a shitty non-english that I always felt to have no useful references, footnotes or revisions specific to era or locale. \n\nAnyhow, sorry for the long rant, but I wanted to let you know all of this because after having it all confirmed and laid out yesterday morning with my psychiatrist I could only think about how to convey the information and writing this has been incredibly therapeutic. I keep revising this, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to stop now. Ask me anything and everything, or nothing, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all good. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just something that I needed to do. Also, seeing you on Sunday was brilliant, Meg and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand weeks where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not around in some capacity. \n\nI tried to make this as ridiculous as possible so as to be palatable, so I hope it was an entertaining as well as informative read."

Next time, i would only take half that amount. And not with even one beer. It was a case of \"i dont feel anything atm, ill have another\" and then bam. Drug texting Blair. Please take the offer of xanax as an intoxicated sign of friendship, and not as an unsavory character offering an illicit and addictive drug that could corrupt your disciplined regime just so that character would seem cool and liked. \nCheers for the Dex!

Such plundering activity causes reverberations among market participants with many engaging in the Gothic mode despite high levels of asymmetrical information which often leads to investors jettisoning long-term plans and (almost willingly) paying whatever is demanded of them by market close. Market disruption of this scale leaves balance sheets weak, with many funds using the AGM to bury any disorientation managers exhibited during the financial year. \nIn this study, several fake funds are setup in order to counter such market reaction by leading herd activity into more rational transactions through sheer scale. We find that the observable impact of the experiment to be negligible, and conclude that any influence from this type of behavior is only recognised by quant-funds (who are already in on it anyway)."

I'm in a group of girls in a game of constantly shuffling tables and chairs trying to make room for everyone. Eventually the school board's militant wing appears and tells us that some of the women are fertile and some aren't, then rounds up the infertile ones. They take them to the locker room showers, string them up, flood the place by turning on all the shower heads and then cut their wrists. Some die, some survive. I couldn't make it in time to help much and between the flooding and the unconscious girls everywhere I could only do so much as one person.\n\nDream 2: I'm working as an electric piano player by day, I have a lot of gigs and get a lot of calls. I drive around to these plentiful local musical gigs and perform for appreciative crowds. I'm skilled and it's a good living. I hit up a studio session at one point and lay down some inspired lines on a hip hop track. I smoke a blunt with the crew and talk them through late-modernism, talking of it's failures, about how the marketplace sabotaged genuine personal transcendence through art."

But I guess I'm less of a Francisco De Miranda and more of a Francisco De Carrie Bradshaw in my belief that sometimes you make your family or sometimes you're born into it and that's just sort of how it is and it isn't much farther from that, because I suppose without others you don't form much of a language or have anyone to convey anything to. It's another school that's not worth subscribing to wholeheartedly. The percolator was just a wild stab in the dark, but it felt appropriate nevertheless. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really happy you appreciate it! A system for precisely extracting yourself a shot of good-quality coffee at home sounds to me like giving the gift of a crack pipe that likely won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t send you to too early a grave, but still provide the euphoric hit often associated. \n\nI too know the feeling of wanting to talk the shapes and contours of a subject and attempting to identify what it encircles hoping to be enlightened enough to perhaps see what encircles it. I appreciate most the quality of hoping to catch one's assumptions and biases as they rise up from the ether of the unconscious, or god forbid somehow manage to leave the conscious mind through the mouth, so as to study them and hope to change how these poor conceptions operate out in the wild in a way that whatever is there in the unconscious that's scanning and processing the heinous amount of data we wade through from bookending breaths can then pay some of whatever constitutes its mind towards making sure at some stage it sends something less embarrassing to the surface for us to have to deal with. \n\nI wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry about proselytising one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perceived inferiority of self. Presuming to know anything is the enemy. Playing with what you think you know is the noblest game. For all intents and purposes one knows nothing, one only thinks they do. Because absolutes are beyond our fragile senses but not beyond the imagination of our fragile minds, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a perfectly reasonable conclusion. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our prison to know how narrow we see. Your order of operations sounds ideal. Point-counterpoint. As Feldman would say, do it one way and then do it another. A lot of people seem to me to pretend they have it all figured out, but no one does, so they play the fool. And not the cool and quietly wise fool of Lear, but the real fool of Lear himself; the dime a dozen motherfuckers we know all too well who call themselves \u00e2\u0080\u009creal men\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the expense of much. \n\nWhat was the wine and how did it fare?\n\nAlso, necessary amendments due to remembering more of the minutiae of club culture: \n\n\"And they are clubbing, the d-floor slamming under the stiletto's and the DJ grinning hideously over his canted bangers. Towering over them all is the judge and he is naked dancing, his small feet lively and quick and now in doubletime and bowing to the bitches, huge and pale and hairless, like an enormous infant. He never pings, he says. He says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never come down. He bows to the DJ and sashays backwards and throws back his head and laughs deep in his throat and he is a great favourite, the judge. He wafts his fedora and the lunar dome of his skull passes palely under the lasers and he swings about and takes possession of one of the turntables and he moonwalks and makes a pass, two passes, dancing and dropping bass at once. His feet are light and nimble. He never pings. He says that he will never come down. He dances in light and in shadow and he is a great favourite. He never pings, the judge. He is dancing, dancing. He says that he will never come down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"

One is beyond my head and the other was new in my concept world, and i had only just discovered that that was what i was more looking for and not \"coding\",  and i was excited to tell what i had found myself, however common knowledge it may already be to people.\n\nAnd i really think we (us) could have a good proper go at the world and its interpretation if we lay out what we've found already and build on that etc. I uave no other goal now other than an honest attempt at a thorough interpretation pf this odd thing Being.\n\nI'm anxiety peaking atm the moment cos a family rift that has been festering for some time has exploded. Im not party to it directly, but i feel i am because like everything it is language games at the heart of it and i need to promote the articulation of the nonsense for all.  \n\nAnyway, you guys i consider family just as much as the blood-tied cluster fuck i already have. My apologies for sentimentality etc it's this needless human dramas that have gotten to me tonight. And that little perculator you guys got me slayed me right in feels. And that club meridian tangent was gold.\n\n I also know i sound like a broken record with my proclamations of inferior intelligence and excuses. It may be my mental habit and afflictions, bit there are solid conditined reasons for that to be the case.\n\nNo need or requirement or obligation  to respond in kind. I think yourself and meg and mainly Mog as exemplary specimens.  I have had some wine tonight because this silly family thing is dumb because poor mum just wants all her children to play nice together and they are all being fucking jerks to do this to a litle old lady however unrelated to mum it is.\n\nIm house sitting in leopold so vinnie left me a beautiful bottle for wine for thanks. It's gone."

And it must be admitted that if the contrast between 'analysis' and 'synthesis' were the operative connotation in the metaphor, then a purely analytic philosophy would be a contradiction in terms. Even if we construe 'analysis' on the analogy of making ever smaller scale maps of the same over all terrain, which does more justice to the synoptic element, the analogy disturbs because we would have to compare philosophy to the making of small-scale maps from an original large-scale map; and a smaller scale map in this sense is a triviality.\nEven if the analogy is changed to that of bringing a picture into focus, which preserves the synoptic element and the theme of working within the frame work of what is already known while adding a dimension of gain, the analogy is disturbing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6[for two reasons]\u00e2\u0080\u009d"

I'm pragmatically weaving much smoother than ever, even if the fabric is alien and gut-wrenching. \nRe your class consciousness raising or consciousness raising class or raising class consciousness, my own fix I jones for is finding that sentence paragraph symbol etc to derail the mind. There are many derailments but there are tracks waiting to catch you on your way to another, or even a level crossing situation. It seems to be what I enjoy doing to people the most, honoured to be able to do it when I can. I need to articulate a better substantial me, as opposed to simply playing with patterned appeals and fallacies just to prove that contradictions exist simply or probably for ego inflating reasons.\nI talk about myself a bunch here, i know. I'm soothing myself after signing an internet contract over the phone. I think I'm doing everything in this house just to show everyone the mouse I killed because they obviously need help. \nEvery day i find the words of people just drift further from the world and further from the connections they themselves attempt to use within their own system. It's like I'm conducting a silent symphony under their pummelling me with drivel and barely disguised resentment. That's not an instant universal write-off, some join with killer solos and backing. \nErgh. And I do have questions banked for you. Like how do you view your beats and sketches recently, after having some time in between? Is your course keeping your attention? I hope it lives to your standards. I worry a lot that it won't."

Hence, its value to the investor depends on the amount invested. We would expect that those with more wealth will buy more information, so that the rate of return on what they have invested should on the average be higher. There is some evidence that this is in fact true empirically.... \n...There are alternative sources of information.

Investors may tend to use readily available information, such as transactions on observable markets, rather than better but scarcer information... \n...the recognition that individuals hold differing information. The term, asymmetric information... \n...The failure of the market to operate too well in these circumstances has led to a literature, usually called mechanism design, on creating incentives, usually within firms, to achieve some improvement. \n...It is also true that uncertainty and informational problems can prevent markets from emerging... For it to exist, it is necessary that all parties understand what state of nature has occurred.

They also allow radically new ways of working. Creativity and collaboration pay off for employers as well. At 839 Collins Street, Zenith is taking that trend even further. Almost everything will be on wheels and able to moved around as the bank's staff shape and match their office space to work demands.\n\n\"All the traditional furniture items have been designed to be modular and mobile to maximise flexibility of the workplace,\" says Zenith's national sales manager Peter Appel.\n\nThat flexibility will extend into break-out spaces and even kitchenettes, which can be unplugged and moved. Another upside for a tenant is its capacity to vacate a space with limited \"make-good\" requirements.\""

Our evidence suggests that managers endowed with a low economic status at birth face higher entry barriers into asset management, and only the highest-quality candidates succeed in entering the profession. This explanation is supported by the evidence on managers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 promotions, which shows that managers with a low endowed status must deliver higher returns to stand a comparable chance of promotion with their high-status peers. We also document that, consistent with the selection mechanism, managers from wealthier backgrounds show a much higher dispersion in their performance than managers of modest decent. \nWe believe our findings have implications that extend beyond asset management. Our evidence suggests that an individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s social status at birth may serve as an important signal of quality in other industries with high barriers to entry, such as corporate management or professional services. We hope that an increased focus on the role of an agent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family background will yield valuable insights into professional decisions of financial intermediaries, corporate managers, and other economic agents. \""

(When Mother first \nheard my percussion quartet years ago in Santa \nMonica, she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI enjoyed it, but where are you \ngoing to put it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d) But music is, or was at one time, \nAmerica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sixth-largest industry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 above or below \nsteel, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember which. Schoenberg used to say\nthat the movie composers knew their business very \nwell. Once he asked those in the class who intended to\nbecome professional musicians to put up their hands.\nNo one did. (Uncle Walter insisted when he married her\nthat Aunt Marge, who was a contralto, should give up\nher career.) My bet is that the phenomenal prices \npaid for paintings in New York at the present time \nhave less to do with art than with business. The lady\nwho lived next door in Santa Monica told me the \npainting she had in her dining room was worth lots of\nmoney. She mentioned an astronomical sum. I said, \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you know?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d seen a small \npainting worth a certain amount, measured it, \nmeasured hers (which was much larger), multiplied, \nand that was that.\""
