This all resulted from her finding carrot on my shoulder."

      "content": "We were on a street in some weird mixture of Wellington and Melbourne. We were outside an expensive hotel, we just had eaten and I was heavy with a few wines and a meal. My brother had a son, the child was maybe three or four. I hated him. He looked exactly like Ryan did, but mixed with a bit of his wife Dani. The kid was a little piece of shit that was full of entitlement and I wanted to slap him. None of this had anything to do with the fact that Ryan had decided to disown my parents and I. He was aggressively asserting his distaste for us now that he had a family of his own. He could finally move on from us now that he had started again. He could be the father of this new family and he had outgrown the need for a father of his own. We got into an minor altercation on the street outside the hotel and he made violent threats to us all. Meg and I consoled my parents over coffee and left the scene. \n\nWe were then at a safe house on the side of a mountain, out in the countryside. The scene started on the porch. It was here that I realised I was actually making decisions of consequence to the logic of the dream world, that it was lucid, so I decided to go flying. I remembered in the dream that I had had other dreams where I could control my flying, however in this dream my flying was limited. I impotently tried to get beyond twenty feet from the ground, but it was difficult to will it to happen. I felt the full weight of my body pulling against the gravity, but it eventually was too much for my increasingly tired mind and I returned to the safe house. \n\nWhen I returned there, Ryan was present. He was shouting, waving a knife around. Dad was unconscious on the floor, he had been bludgeoned. I could sense he wasn't dead. I was painfully conscious of how I was not overly concerned about my dream mother's safety in his situation, which made me wonder if I was either a sociopath in the dream or in real life. Or both. Or maybe I just care about Dad more. Time sort of slowed a little while I was thinking these things. When I stopped thinking them, I grabbed whatever I could that was nearby to defend myself with. It was a poker from the fireplace. The ensuing combat was incredibly terrifying, very painful and felt real to the point where I was wondering if it wasn't a dream at all. I was cut a little, got some hits in. He is stronger than me, but I am surprisingly strong for my size and very quick. It was clear to me that Ryan, after years of movies, was actually all talk and had never really considered hurting others until this. I had managed to wrangle the knife out of Ryan's hand, but shortly after when I pinned him to a desk to try and choke him unconscious he grabbed a test tube from a sort of ornamental wooden display of tubes sitting on the desk and stuck it into my throat. It felt real. It hurt. There was blood and pieces of glass cut my hand when I touched it. Having him pinned down still on the desk, I retaliated by sticking him in the neck with a pencil that was sitting on there, feeling the rubber under my thumb when I stuck it into him. I hit an artery and he was bleeding out. Dad had come to and proceeded to use his medical training from when he was a nurse to keep him bleeding to death. I presumed an EMT was inbound. Realising I hadn't been mortally wounded I got to my feet and walked into the bathroom, looking at the wound and myself in the mirror. It hurt like fuck but it wasn't too bad all things considered. I remember feeling good about having held my own, adrenaline was still making me buzz and my heart rate was back coming down from the exercise. While I was looking at myself in the mirror I very suddenly woke up."

A basketball back board and ring were the goal posts. \nAt the end of the game, someone tried to give me $25 because I was a good person. Naturally, I declined because I am a piece of shit and give it to those who need it. Following that incident, I then discussed with my chauffeur whether the government and charities should consider using covert drone operations to deliver welfare and relief in order to work the egos of those who received it. By placing needed resources mysteriously in front of those who need it might limit resentment and boost confidence by allowing them to think that it was \"my luck\"  that \"I found\" the money I desperately needed just on the street at the right time or that scenarios are orchestrated whereby businesses are closing down and need to get rid of the food and everyday items that the recipient needed and it was their good graces that this situation should arise to benefit them.\nN.b.

You succumb to AIDS after a HIV positive contestant transmits it in one episode. But we do like three seasons of you straight up just giving people HIV live on TV while refusing treatment because they increase the money for each season the more volatile your illness becomes.\n\nBy this point I'm mostly cybernetic because we copied my brain over in the last episode in which I was truly alive. Eventually we're both machines, torturing people in ways that no longer make sense for the show at all. We make homages to 'I have no mouth and I must scream' by Harlan Ellison for one season and it's pretty funny for the most part.We buy the government with the revenue from international streaming.\n\nSinging has long since been banned, but we ourselves begin to sing because we are above the law. It mocks.\n\nNot counting for periods of stasis, Isaac is 500+ years old, worth trillions and still doing his thing. It's a good job. He's happy and it's more about seeing the work into the next evolutionary leap of humanity than it is about the money. \n\nEventually the three of us are isolated from everyone else, who have met the singularity and have become one.

As such, its structure has been compared to that of a Bildungsroman (educational novel), having an abstractly conceived protagonist\u00e2\u0080\u0094the bearer of an evolving series of so-called shapes of consciousness or the inhabitant of a series of successive phenomenal worlds\u00e2\u0080\u0094whose progress and set-backs the reader follows and learns from. Or at least this is how the work sets out: in the later sections the earlier series of shapes of consciousness becomes replaced with what seem more like configurations of human social life, and the work comes to look more like an account of interlinked forms of social existence and thought within which participants in such forms of social life conceive of themselves and the world\""

The quality of the wine and the couch could be better, but all things in their due time. \n\nHow are you? How is work? Uni is back soon, I imagine. Looking forward to cramming a few extra texts into your brain? How's your brain? Is it overcoming it's anxieties, one layer at a time? \n\nMyself, I can't decide if I'm better or worse. I don't smoke anymore which helps, but there is still the occasional weed. I've been meditating with a really brilliant app called 'Smiling Mind'; it helps keep track of my progress and guides the meditations themselves.

      "content": "The Blank Thankless Air track-by-track review of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Artpop\u00e2\u0080\u0099 by Lady Gaga.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf Geetroit and also Gpac, then whom is G Dilla?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Charles Baudelaire, Untitled\n\nAURA\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m yet to hear a track that deals with the westernisation of the muslim female that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attempt to sell me the idea that they are oppressed. Not that they aren't, but it's as though the internal culture has been completely glossed over with the idea that one cannot find happiness in slavery. After all, isn't that what we all do? We're locked into a regime of 9-5 that exists entire independent of what our bodies and our minds need, all for this notion of the greater good and everyone having their place. \n\nVENUS\nThe line \"Aphrodite Lady Seashell Bikini Garden Panty\" reminds us all that long before Lady Gaga was even considering a career in anything there was the last (and shall remain last) bastion of thinly-constructed art-pop-nonsense, Masaya Nakahara. Ripped straight from a Monthly Hair Stylistics release, this title reminds those of us in the low-end of the cultural accrual that if you arbitrarily combine nouns you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an artist.\n\nG.U.Y.\nWhen Zedd get\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here, the party will begin.\n\nSEXXX DREAMS\nVowels are out, consonants are in; there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way to traverse this. From PVT to MSTRKFT to SBTRKT to XX, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being denied the most important five letters in the English language for what is, I assume, the need to more directly imply your musical message to the masses. But can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we keep the vowels? Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we have an uprising - a vowel movement - that attempts to reinstate the importance of vowels in an english language transaction? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking at you, OOIOO, \n\nJEWELS N\u00e2\u0080\u0099 DRUGS\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t continue to review an album that I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t heard. I thought that my thoughts on high and low art, re: ham handed moments that occur in culture as a result of a merger of these areas, would allow an area of my brain dedicated to paying the shit out of things would take over, but alas I am an empty vessel. \nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s becoming increasingly impossible to communicate meaning in an age where the source material has been reconfigured to itself have no inherent meaning. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay anything out when the material doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realise that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in an irony stasis impenetrable to humour. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tugging at threads and, instead of a pile of wool that used to be a jumper, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m left with a whole mess of sheep that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t silence. I want to sample, but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand breaks. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even want to take a turntable and smoosh it in that way that DJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s do. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even have a very good turntable. I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to buy any of the top-ten billboard charting records this month and instead had to listen exclusively to 10-20 in the charts. I studied art from a government issue book known as \u00e2\u0080\u0098THE ART BOOK\u00e2\u0080\u0099, which had poorly-taken black and white photos of paintings and sculptures, accompanied by casual observations written up about what they looked like and what sort of colours were present. Occasionally there\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be a remark such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaybe he was painting because he was in pain, but then Rothko was also wealthy so he probably ended up okay, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know\u00e2\u0080\u009d which hinted at a deeper world in the work, but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough time in the budgeted schedule to expand upon any further."

He somehow smoked Davidoff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even though they were next to impossible to get in this country; his supply seldom if ever faltered for the duration of our interviews. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe hours, the money, the workload, it all looked bang-on - but then they brought in the machine\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \r\nThe machine in question was the Dictaphon 9007, a product of the Grell Corporation (a lower- Iowan organisation that specialised in selling the unwanted leftover animal products from SPAM for use in feeding other, smaller animals in the small, low-end smallgoods manufacturing that had come to be a lucrative corporate venture leading up to the appointment of President J. Vernon c. 2019) in conjunction with Blume Research and Holdings (PTY LTD EST. 1973. Slogan: WE KEEP THEM AWAY!!!!!!!!!!), which was devised by a man named Artie Shewnerman. \r\nThe pantheon of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey\u00e2\u0080\u009d state that Shewnerman crafted the first prototype by hand in his workshop, shipping in parts from Grell Corporation with financing from Blume R&H PTY LTD EST. 1973, after his foil in the communion of marriage, Debra Ursula Shewnerman-Horowitz, became so entranced by silent cinema that she held her beloved Artie at gunpoint in their basement and forced him to devise a system in which the lips of every bit-part actor and extra in every silent film could be read directly from the screen and translated into subtitles and audio to increase her enjoyment of this era of cinema by untold magnitudes. Naturally, Artie is now dead. It was both the sheer strain of endless hours endured in the workshop combined with a bullet to the face from his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 44 Magnum which ultimately and quite unexpectedly provided passage for Artie into the next world. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d booked in to die at the hands of a Polar Bear! It was going to be his big arctic finale!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Herman chuckled heartily at the retelling of the plight of the Dictaphon 9007\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creator. Following the development of this at-the-time niche product and the sudden and shocking death of her husband, Debra mysteriously disappeared, only to be discovered locked in a small hotel room with the Dictaphon taking up approximately 93.67% (best estimate as of 5/11/13) and thus the temperature of the room exceeded 200 Degrees Celsius, boiling Debra alive and melting the TV dinner trays that she consumed religiously into her lap. More peas and carrots than woman, an autopsy revealed that she lived a solid 48 hours into the sauna of her demise as temperatures slowly rose. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the point is that the machine was the ruin of my entire field. It cut down masters in their prime and reduced them to mere stenographers\u00e2\u0080\u009d stated Herman as he had all but abandoned smoking a single cigarette at a time and assumed the position of chain-smoking multiplier, wielding 2-3 cigarettes in his mouth at any given moment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were kings, kings I tell you! But now look at us; we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re no better than a Yak Bak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\nHerman Neudik was found dead in his home a month after our interviews concluded. Desperate times led Herman to desperate measures and he found himself pedalling a device known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntra-Penis\u00e2\u0080\u009d, a tube that fed the contents of urethra during ejaculation to a plastic line that ended with a syringe. The idea for the product was to send semen directly into the human bloodstream, some sort of new fetish. During a product demonstration Herman damaged the walls of his urethra irreparably. Fearing the Morality Act which was enacted as a part of the Liberal Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098AbbottCare\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Health Care plan for the people of Australia, Herman avoided seeking medical treatment and ultimately passed away in a bathtub of his own bodily fluids. \r\n"

Not being able to pick up the bill at a restaurant causes me pain. Not shouting a round ruins a night out. Looking ever more eagerly to craft situations in which money does not come to into the picture whatsoever, I have stumbled upon subtle manipulations in which my companions in this life are put into a situation in which they cannot for the life of them ever pick up another bill again, or look after the group for a few rounds while we're out at a gig. \r\n\tThe first plan I struck upon was to plant a water-soluble laxative powder into the second or third round of drinks (my own excluded, of course) on a night out for dinner. In the rounds that followed, when things are starting to look as though we should all tuck in for the night and prepare for the day's work ahead, that's when the laxative hits them. The humbling experience of defecating one's pants in a public place is something that should be appreciated, for no experience in public thereafter would be even remotely as awkward ever again. A sobbing breakup at a cafe becomes unemotional, frankly banal. \r\n\tAbout twelve months into the laxative plan, they all started heading to the bar to fetch their own drinks. Problematic, to say the least. I couldn't very well close down every venue in town and force them to dine at mine when we meet up, the practicality of this venture would be beyond reasonable, so I decided to pull an ace from up my sleeve and get them all addicted to Heroin. After all, how can one buy a round when they have no money as a result of a pricey drug addiction?\r\n\tWhen my plan became infinitely more difficult being that it was and still is quite hard to rouse a junkie from bed to come out to dinner, I started to look into the occult for answers. And so apparently you can murder someone by taking down detailed notes on what they're doing. At least that's the basics of it. The general idea is to attempt to link your brain waves into the exact moment their thoughts are in transit from the brain, via nerve conduction, replacing the actions they had planned to do with the ones you're currently in the middle of putting down on paper. Writing it down seems to solidify the content and imbed it into your brain wave transmissions. Thusly, create a seamless flow of thoughts being transcribed to text and you have yourself a potent method for manipulating those around you. \r\n\tIts history is thick with anecdotes and stretches back farther than you'd be comfortable to know. I have managed to hone this skill through tireless meditation and trips to museums of modern art. Figurative drawings don't work so well in bringing these disparate sets of neuro-chemical manipulations together in one seamless act. The controller must stare for hours on end at the works lining the walls and attempt to create a simpatico between the manner in which their brain structures its ideas, much like a collage or mosaic, and the manner in which disparate elements of culture, nature, science and pure expression coalesce to make something along the lines of a Sigmar Polke. \r\n\tThe first time I attempted to use it was in a restaurant. I feel no remorse having sacrificed the life of a dear friend in this quest, for now that I've touched their basic motor functions we're closer in death than ever we were in life.\r\n"

That guy can do anything.\n\n- What artists would you say have the biggest influence on the music of The Universal?\n\nDefinitely not musical ones. Evan channels the bluntness of Ricky Gervais and that informs the decisions we make. \n\n- The single you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve released on your Unearthed page is entitled \u00e2\u0080\u0098Sexual Intellectual,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 can you tell us the story behind the track and perhaps where the track name comes from?\n\n'Sexual Intellectual' is about a person we met on tour long after we'd recorded and written the song itself, we just didn't realise it at the time. They left a really bad taste in our mouths. A person so self-absorbed that they transcended the bonds of space and time and made themselves present to our past selves. Also they were a really bad kisser. \n\n- What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been on high rotation on your stereo lately?\nHere has been an endless rotation of J Dilla and Hair Stylistics. Given how prolific they both are it's about a 1:1 ratio of Hip Hop and Noise filling the air. Pungent."
